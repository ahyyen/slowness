            Every day, the prospect of a happy, fulfilling life seems
            increasingly distant. All that's left for us is a future where
            nothing is guaranteed—not happiness, nor stability, nor comfort. Our
            very lives aren’t guaranteed in a system built to screw over all but
            a “lucky” few.
          </p>
          <p class="presentclick">
            How do they do it? Our parents, our grandparents, our professors,
            our fellow students, even?

                Keep on living, keep on pushing forward, no matter how tired you
                get.

                    Well, it’s not like we have much of a choice. We can’t cut
                    ourselves out of this system. To live is to participate,
                    whether we like it or not. But, though we may be compelled
                    to keep running and running with our eyes trained on the
                    imaginary finish line, that doesn’t mean we must surrender
                    ourselves completely to the never-ending race.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yes, we cannot afford to stop moving forward. But that
                    doesn’t mean we cannot still slow down, take time to
                    breathe, and express care and love for our fellow human
                    beings.

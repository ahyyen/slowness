        So success is measured by victory? What is victory, exactly? What does
        it mean to “win” this neoliberal game? When you’ve gained all that there
        is to gain? When every other person lies disposed at your feet? We both
        know that’s impossible. Would you really let yourself be consumed by an
        unattainable delusion? Would you really sacrifice love, joy, all
        possibility of connection and companionship, everything for a futile
        battle for the top?

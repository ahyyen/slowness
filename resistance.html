            Indeed, the neoliberal world seeks to commodify us. Pit us against
            each other, singing false promises of success for the victors. But
            we, the actors, the runners in this race, are waking up. More and
            more, we realize that the course neoliberalism seeks to set for our
            lives is not the only path available. In fact, it’s not even the
            best one. If we want life to be less daunting, this is a truth we
            must accept.

                But for all your talk of resistance, tell me this. What could
                one person do? What could any of us do? The price of rejecting
                society is that society rejects you back. It couldn’t care less.

                    Resistance is not all-or-nothing. It does not have to be an
                    explosion, a violent battle cry, an outright declaration of
                    war. Most importantly, the price of resistance is not a
                    price one must bear <a href = "love.html" class="futureclick">alone</a>.

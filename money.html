        So success is measured in economic output? Self-worth is measured by
        productivity? Is that why you’re constantly pressured to hustle? To get
        work done? To accomplish something? Every second of every day, if you’re
        not doing something that grants you an economic advantage, or at the
        very least a chance at an economic advantage, does that make you a
        failure? Does “wasting time” to eat make you a failure? Does “wasting
        time” to sleep make you a failure? Does “wasting time” to build
        friendships make you a failure?

        So success is measured by happiness? Then what does it mean when the
        system we live in weaponizes that very concept? The idea that despair is
        a sign of personal failure, of worthlessness. Surely, those who struggle
        to achieve happiness are not worth keeping around, right? Instead of
        offering help, instead of relieving them of even a small fraction of the
        stresses and burdens that impede their happiness, itâ€™s okay to simply
        forget about them, right?

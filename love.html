            Do you remember a time when the future didn’t seem so terrifying?
            Remember when you were young, and you didn’t fully understand what
            it meant to grow up, but you knew that it meant freedom? You knew
            that it meant understanding more about the world, more about
            yourself, and being able to choose what you wanted to do. And, in
            that innocent view of the future, one thing remained constant—the
            presence of a loving family and caring friends.
          </p>
          <p class="futureclick">It was a future surrounded by love.</p>

              <p>
                Why shouldn’t that future become a reality? Can we not still
                choose to love and care for one another just for the sake of it?
                In a world that pushes individualism and self-interest, the
                choice to love one another is a display of strength. Even if it
                slows us down, even if it means risking criticism and ridicule,
                even if it means expressing vulnerability and weakness in a
                world that punishes such qualities.
              </p>
              <p class="futureclick">To choose to love, again and again.</p>

                            Together, carving out small pockets of resistance
                            through collective care and collective hope. Sharing
                            the burden of precarity and risk, creating our own
                            stability. We can’t build a new world in one day. Or
                            one year. Or ten, even. But change happens. The
                            seeds are there. And when they are nurtured by the
                            hands of mutual care, the roots that grow between
                            the cracks have the power to undermine the hegemony
                            of fear.

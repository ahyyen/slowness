      <h2>performance</h2>
      <p class="present">
        Life is a performance. Society is our stage. And our audience? The
        neoliberal social order. We can choose who we present ourselves to be,
        so long as it satisfies our audience. But our audience is quite picky.
        If they are not satisfied, they pluck us from the stage and wait for
        better actors to take our places. The self does not belong to us. The
        self is a commodity. The self is a brand.

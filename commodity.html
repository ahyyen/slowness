            The world treats us as products with no inherent value. That makes
            us all disposable. To avoid such a fate, we must constantly
            optimize. Level up, like a video game character. Gain skills, gain
            stats, gain connections.

                But neither of us blindly believe that, do we? The value of a
                human being is not measured by statistics. We don’t choose our
                friends based on their financial status, or their GPA, or how
                many languages they can speak, or how many awards they’ve won.
                When our friends show weakness, we don’t abandon them and
                replace them with someone "better", like the system would do to
                us.
